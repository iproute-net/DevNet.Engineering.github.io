Welcome to **DevNetEngineering** blog. I am seeking to become a DevNet Architect and will share my journey as I work towards becoming a Network Automation Architect, documenting keynotes along the way.
The aim of this blog is to practice writing code for network automation, which includes developing tools for network engineering.
